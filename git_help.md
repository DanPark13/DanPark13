# Resources for Setting up Git on New Device

It's funny how much I have to do this

## Tutorial Links:
- Setting Up `git_configs`: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup
- Generating `ssh` keys to device: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent
- Adding `ssh` keys to GitHub: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account

Accessing Key Settings (finding this link is always a pain): https://github.com/settings/keys
