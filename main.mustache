Welcome to my page! My name is {{name}}, and I'm a junior at the Franklin W. Olin College of Engineering studying Engineering in Computing (CS). I'm interested in AI Applications, Front-end Engineering, UX Design, and Tech Education! I have previous interned at [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com/) as a Business Enablement Solutions Analyst and [Saudi Aramco](https://www.aramco.com/) as a [Digital Transformation Intern](https://youtu.be/l2-v8Wp2RjI?t=203).

While you're here, feel free to check out what I've been [working on](https://github.com/DanPark13?tab=repositories) and I'd love to [connect](https://www.linkedin.com/in/danielpark13/)!
